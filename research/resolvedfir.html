            <h3>In general, more energetic events happen at shorter wavelengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>ultraviolet (UV): young, massive stars</li>
                <li>optical to near-infrared (NIR): older stars</li>
                <li>mid-to-far-infrared (MIR-FIR): interstellar dust</li>

            <h4>My goal is to <span class="highlight">use the UV-FIR pixels of Andromeda as a training set</span>, in order to learn a mapping from UV-MIR (input) to FIR (output).</h4>

            <h4>Then, even for galaxies where we do not have FIR data, I can predict the FIR image.</h4>
            <h4>I can use the galaxies where FIR is available as a test set.</h4>
